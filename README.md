# AstroBot
This script in python gets the AstroPhotography Of the Day (APOD) from NASA.APOD and Astrobin APOD and post in a twitter account using Twitter API.

For use this script, you will need to get yours keys from Twitter API and put then in a archive called keys.txt one by line in this order:

api_key '\n' 
api_secret_key '\n'
access_token '\n'
access_token_secret '\n'

Make sure the api_key is in the first line, api_secret_key in second line, acess_token in third line and acess_token_secret in the last line. And, of course, this keys.txt
need to be in the same folder than ASTROBOT.py

This script generate 2 jpeg files, one named file_to_upload.jpeg and another called astrobin.jpeg and use this 2 images to make the post in twitter.

Enjoy!
